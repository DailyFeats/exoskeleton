# scoliosis

Experiment in making better Backbone.js drop-in replacement.

## What already works

Well, [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org) passes all its tests with Scoliosis instead of Backbone. Thatâ€™s it. All features you need for real-world app seems to be working.

## Current features

* Custom build (you can `cat` stuff now)
* No hard dependencies on underscore or jquery
* Query-string router
* Support for Bower and Component(1)
* AMD support
* Speed
* View#noWrap (maybe)
* View#delegateEvents(keepOld)
* Object.create(null) https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/1495

## Differences

- In no-underscore environment, there are no underscore-inspired
  Collection methods (each, pluck etc.), but there are ES5-inspired methods:
  ```
  ['forEach', 'map', 'filter', 'some', 'every', 'reduce', 'reduceRight',
    'indexOf', 'lastIndexOf']
  ```

  Also, no underscore-inspired Model methods at all.

- emulateHTTP and emulateJSON were removed
